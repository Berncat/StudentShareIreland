# StudentShareIreland

This is an android studio / kotlin based project.

This is my first time using both.

My app is based on the idea of students posting up spare rooms they have available.

Features are limited, as I said this is first venture into mobile web development.

Main things to note:

- Persistence is done by JSON using gson.
- Full CRUD
- Basic auth using boolean
- Map usage including geocoding
- Input data validation
- I tried to follow the Gitflow model for my commits.

What I found challenging was moving back to a more strict type based language like Kotlin.

Also I was not a huge fan of Android studio at the start but it is slowly growing on me.

Things I found useful outside of my lecture material

 - Seems obvious but top ones were:
 - the Android developer documents
 - Kotlin documentation
 - Material IO docs
 - google map docs

geocoding - I found this somewhat useful: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-mez3LOOVc&t=91s

I went through an exhaustive amount of resources trying to get the spinner working so I can' actually tell you which one gave me the answer was probably bits from everywhere.

I also persisted very hard to try and get more then one image uploaded looking at clipdata and allow multiple files on the image picker. I almost got it but it just was not to be.

Main things I like are the search function. I think having the radius is pretty cool to show which ones are close to which college.

Here is link to demo video:


Over all an enjoyable project with alot of things learned.
